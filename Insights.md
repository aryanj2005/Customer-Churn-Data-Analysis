Senior citizens have a higher churn probability compared to younger customers.

Customers with lower monthly incomes also show higher churn.

Customers with month-to-month contracts are the most likely to churn.

Two-year contracts have the lowest churn rate, showing that longer commitments reduce churn risk.

Customers without online security and tech support services churn at much higher rates.

Bundled services reduce churn likelihood, suggesting upselling multiple services could improve retention.
