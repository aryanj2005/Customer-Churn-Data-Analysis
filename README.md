# 📊 Customer Churn Data Analysis using Python 

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical challenge for businesses, especially in subscription-based industries such as telecom, banking, SaaS, and e-commerce.  
This project analyzes customer churn data using Python to identify **key drivers of attrition** and build a framework for predicting customers who are likely to leave.  

The goal is to help businesses **reduce churn rate, improve retention strategies, and increase long-term profitability** through data-driven decisions.
